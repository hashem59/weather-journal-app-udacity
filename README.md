# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Theough this project we created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## How it Works
1. recieves a zip code from the user 
2. send get request to OpenWeatherMap.com to Get Temperature
3. send temp along with user MSG to our server
4. then retiriveve the data from the server and update the UI with it
